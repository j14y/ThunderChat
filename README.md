## WhatsApp for iPad™ Install Guide

1. Download Xcode from the App Store on your MacOS device
2. Sign into Xcode using the prompts and your Apple ID
3. Download the folder ‘WhatsApp for iPad’
4. Open the folder using Xcode, unzipping it if necessary
5. Connect your iPad via USB
6. Navigate to the active scheme, which should say the app name, followed by an Apple device (i.e. WhatsApp for iPad > iPhone 6)
7. Click the right hand side of the active scheme, and navigate to your device from the pop up, and then select it
.8 Click the run/play button, on the top left corner on the screen

## Caveats
*Some additional concerns when installing the application and troubleshooting.*

- When adding the application to your device you may have to enable a setting on your device so that it can be installed. Go to Settings > General > Device Management and then click the item that appears under the Developer App heading, and then click Trust. The application will then properly install onto the device.
- When you open the application in Xcode you will see the Xcode Project Properties page which includes headings such as Identity, Signing and Deployment Info. Go to the Signing heading and make such that the ‘Automatically manage signings’ box is ticked and a team is selected (if you signed in with your Apple ID it will most probably be your name followed by ‘Personal Team’ in brackets). The remaining two fields under the Team field should be filled in automatically (that is, uneditable).

> The ones on the app store atm are ridiculous with ads

## How to use

Scan the QR code that appears when first opening the application using your mobile phone and it ensure that it is always connected to the internet.

*That's it.*

## App issues
*Issues that need attention, in order of importance.*
